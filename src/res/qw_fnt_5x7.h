// This is an experimental library to control SSD1680/1 e-Paper displays via I2C, using a TI MSP430FR2433 as the I2C to SPI Bridge.
//
// The MSP430FR2433 is configured as a I2C peripheral with two registers: Control (Register 0x00), and Data (Register 0x01).
// All data written to Register 0x00 is bridged to SPI with the D/C# pin held low.
// All data written to Register 0x01 is bridged to SPI with the D/C# pin held high.
